This repo will host some cool labs, which will help me refresh my memory quickly as well as help others get a grip on new tools and technologies in a very isolated, independent and DIY way . Doing exercises this way will also boost investigative troubleshooting skills. There are no 'right' or 'wrong' ways to achieve the goals in any of these exercises, Do it the way you feel is best, Pls don't forget to submit a pull request you add/correct something. Happy to  have your changes integrated.
