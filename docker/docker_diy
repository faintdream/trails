# Task 

Create a docker containers that does following,

* runs a website with nginx as front end and mysql as backend 
* the content of this website comes via a php page 



## Hint

For front end

* since this is a custom solution, you may want to start with an empty Dockerfile

* Think about what FROM  is good( an official image for centos/ubuntu or may be nginx)

* how would you build this image ?

* how would you run and test this image, provided it runs on port 80 ( do you need to start the newly built container ? )

* you may want to run webserver and db on separate containers

* why do you think, it is not a good idea to have them both run from same container [ INTERVIEW BROWNY :-) ]
